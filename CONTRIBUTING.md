# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via discussions or via an informal method such as Discord.

Please note we have a code of conduct and it's simply 1 rule, don't be a dickhead.

# Coding Style

- Minimum version of Python to use during development and testing must be 3.10.12
- Always use [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) when possible as they are far more superior than `%` and `.format()` in most cases.
- Always write tests for any new functions/API calls implemented or changed (if the logic has changed)
- All functions should follow the typical API documentation format, more on this can be found here `to-do`
- List comprehensions should always be used where possible unless the code is too ugly and readable, that is for you and the reviewer to agree with :-)
